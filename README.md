- This project was developped on Unity 2019.3.14f1
- It was build only for Android devices but you can build it for iOS thanks to Xcode.
- If you just want to play the game, you'll need an android device

## Getting Started

### Installing

Press play to start the game, you'll get something like this:<br/>

Here you can use the buttons to move the tetramino left/right/down. There is also a specal button to rotate the tetramino.
